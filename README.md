## ðŸŽ¨ Image Optimization with Cloudflare

This project uses Cloudflare's image optimization service instead of Sharp. This provides several benefits:

- Better performance on Cloudflare's infrastructure
- Automatic image optimization and delivery
- Global CDN distribution

The image configuration is set in `astro.config.mjs` and the `<Image>` components use the `quality={"high"}` parameter which is specific to Cloudflare's image service.
